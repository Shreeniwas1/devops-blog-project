# Quick PlantUML Preview Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start - View Diagrams Online

1. **Go to PlantUML Online Editor**: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
2. **Copy any diagram content** from the `.puml` files
3. **Paste into the editor** and view the rendered diagram
4. **Export as PNG/SVG** if needed

## 📋 Available Diagrams Overview

| Diagram | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `system-architecture.puml` | Overall system design | All components, data flow, external services |
| `kubernetes-architecture.puml` | K8s cluster details | Pods, services, ingress, storage |
| `deployment-flow.puml` | CI/CD process | Developer to production flow |
| `application-flow.puml` | User interactions | Frontend to backend to database |
| `monitoring-architecture.puml` | Observability stack | Prometheus, Grafana, metrics |
| `security-architecture.puml` | Security measures | All security layers and controls |
| `database-design.puml` | Data layer design | Schema, relationships, performance |
| `development-workflow.puml` | Local dev setup | Setup scripts, Minikube, port forwarding |
| `cicd-pipeline.puml` | Pipeline details | Jenkins stages, gates, notifications |

## 🛠️ Local Rendering (Optional)

If you have Java installed, you can render diagrams locally:

```bash
# Download PlantUML JAR
wget https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases/download/v1.2023.12/plantuml-1.2023.12.jar

# Generate single diagram
java -jar plantuml-1.2023.12.jar system-architecture.puml

# Generate all diagrams
java -jar plantuml-1.2023.12.jar *.puml

# Generate as SVG
java -jar plantuml-1.2023.12.jar -tsvg *.puml
```

## 🔍 Validation

Run the validation script to check all diagrams:

```bash
./validate-diagrams.sh
```

## 📝 Key Fixed Issues

The following issues were resolved in the database design:

1. **Complete field definitions** - Added default values and constraints
2. **Enhanced Posts table** - Added author, slug, published fields for better blog functionality  
3. **Improved indexes** - Added performance-optimized indexes
4. **Method completeness** - Added missing CRUD operations
5. **Proper relationships** - Ensured all foreign key relationships are correctly defined

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Use the online editor to view any diagram
2. Copy diagrams into documentation as needed
3. Update diagrams as the project evolves
4. Generate final images for project deliverables
